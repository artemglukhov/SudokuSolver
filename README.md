# SudokuSolver

Simple sudoku solver through a recursion, a bit raw.
Insert sudoku board into m[81], 0 for empty space, 1X for numbers (for example 14 instead of 4, 11 instead of 1: 
I used this method because it was simple to let the function know if it was an already written number or if it was added later).

KNOWN BUGS:
  It sometimes writes 0 instead of 9, don't know why!
